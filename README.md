## Launchpad Part 1 (Countdown)

### Assignment Description

the **countdown** assignment was intended to test a program that would fix the broken space launch pad and accuratly allow the astronauts to launch a ship at the end of the countdown

### Evidence 

![the countdown ran completely](./images/launchpad%20countdown.PNG)

### Wiring

no wiring was needed other than a pico baord connection to the device. 

### Code 

[Launch Pad Part One.](raspberry-pi/Launch%20Pad%20Part_1)

### Reflection

This assignment was challenging because of the language and making the [**for-loop**] encrement the numebers decreasing from [one] to [10]. After some testing, I was able to figure out how to increment the numbers negatively.

## Launch Pad Part 2 (lights)

### Assignment Description

This assignment was to add **LEDs** to the countdown so that the astronauts are aware of

What went wrong / was challenging, how'd you figure it out, and what did you learn from that experience? Your goal for the reflection is to pass on knowledge that will make this assignment better or easier for the next person. Think about your audience for this one, which may be "future you" (when you realize you need some of this code in three months), me, or your college admission committee!

## Launch Pad Part 3 (button)


### Assignment Description

The **button** assignement was intended to add a manual lanuch system that would allow the countdown to start only by command. This assignment would all the rocket to stay put until all other actions have been completed and a given command by the push of the button would allow it to launch.

### Wiring

### Code

[launch pad part 3 (button) code](raspberry-pi/Launch%20Pad%20Part_3)



### Reflection

This assignement was challenging with getting the button statements and variables. It was solved by getting the dircetion of the **botton** *input* and simply adding a [**while**] loop and using an [**if**] statment to check *if* the **button** has been pressed. I was able to learn that you don't need all the pins of the button to make it function as intended. Only two wires on the same side would be enough. Secondly, some [**GP**] pins share the same **PWM** frequency.

## Launch Pad Part 4 (servo)

### Assignment Description

This assignment made the engineers launch the spaceship from a launch pad that could move and let the rocket go as it launched by the end of the countdown. 


### Evidence

### Wiring

This may not be applicable to all assignments. Anything where you wire something up, include the wiring diagram here. The diagram should be clear enough that I can recreate the wiring from scratch. 

### Code

[launch pad part 4 (code)](raspberry-pi/Launch%20Pad%20Part_4)

### Reflection

This assignment was challenging in that it was difficult in getting the servo to work. It was however much easier because the code was similar to the **led** and **button**. The Servo at somepoint wouldn't spin 180 degrees and wouldn't reset after it had finished running. IT was solved by testing different angles, and getting the servo to spin back to (**0**) after it was done.
